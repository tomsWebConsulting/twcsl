            the format of each line is a search text and a replacement text or
            replacement text function
            
            if the text has single quotes in them then put a backslash before
            the single quotes. example: it's becomes it\'s
            
            search text can be a string or a regular expression, backslashes
            need to be escaped in regular expressions
            
            replacement text can use regular expression grouping syntax when the
            search text is a regular expression
            
            replacement text functions need to accept a node, stop and start
            observer parameters and return replacement text or false. if a
            callback returns false the rest of the callbacks won't be called
            
            following are example lines. copy an example line below and paste
            after the example lines. remove '// ' at beginning of pasted line.
            repeat for as many times as needed
