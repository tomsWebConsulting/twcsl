* Install **[Store Page Price Change][6]**. After you install the code be sure
  to continue on with the rest of the steps.
  
* Options

    * Use this option if you have only a single page you want to have this
      effect.
      
    * Add code from file **[store page detail price variant add.html][7]** to
      Store Settings > Advanced > Page Header Code Injection for the store page.
      Refer to [Per-page code injection][8] for details.
      
  * Site-wide
  
    * Use this option if you have multiple pages where you want to have this
      effect.
      
    * Add code from file **[store page detail price variant add.html][7]** to
      Website > Pages > Website Tools > Code Injection > FOOTER. Refer to [Add
      code to code injection][9] for details.
      
* Read the code for any instructions within.

* Add the following to searchReplaceText in the store page price change code per
  that codes instructions.
  
  ```
      // store page detail price variant add
      
      "[enter search text here between single quotes replacing square brackets]" : "twcSpdpva",
    ```
    
  The search text you enter needs to target the end of the price. For prices
  that end with a currency symbol, it is easy. For example if the currency is
  Euros then you enter **â‚¬** for search text. If the price ends with numbers
  then things get a bit trickier. You need to use a regular expression. For
  example **/(\\\d+(?:,\\\d{3})*)(\\\\.\\\d{2})?/**.

## Note

This code only works for one variant.
