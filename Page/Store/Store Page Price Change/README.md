## searchReplaceText Example Lines

```
      // remove word from
      
      "from" : "",
  ```

```
      // change language of word from, from english to swedish
      
      "from" : "fra",
  ```

```
      // remove zero decimal from price
      
      ".00" : "",
  ```

```
      /*
      
        remove decimal from price, using regular expression, backslash must
        be escaped with \, the replacement text uses special replacement
        patterns
        
        */
        
      "/(\\d+(?:,\\d{3})*)(?:\\.\\d{2})?/" : "$1",
  ```

```
      // add thousands separator
      
      "/\\d(?=(?:\\d{3})+(?!\\d))/g" : "$&,",
  ```

```
      // replacement text callback name
      
      "log" : "twcSppcl",
  ```

## Callbacks

For an example of how to write a callback please see [Store Page Price Change
Log][11]. If a callback returns false the rest of the callbacks won't be called.

## Note

Changing prices on a Store page does not affect the cart, checkout, or other
Squarespace pages/backend storage. This is purely a cosmetic change. No code can
change the checkout page or SS backend. It is an SS security feature.
