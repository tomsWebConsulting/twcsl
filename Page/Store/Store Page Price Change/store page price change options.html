          the format of each line is a search text and a replacement text or
          replacement text function
          
          if the text has single quotes in them then put a backslash before
          the single quotes. example: it's becomes it\'s
          
          search text can be a string or a regular expression, backslashes
          need to be escaped in regular expressions
          
          replacement text can use regular expression grouping syntax when the
          search text is a regular expression
          
          replacement text functions need to accept node, isDetail, text, and
          searchText parameters. the function must return replacement text or a
          boolean. true tells the code to continue to the next search/replace
          pair without making the replacement. false means skip all further
          replacements. your function needs to be defined before this code runs
          
          following are example lines. copy an example line below and paste
          after the example lines. remove '// ' at beginning of pasted line.
          repeat for as many times as needed
