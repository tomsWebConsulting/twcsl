## Note

This code is client side and it is possible to bypass it. In other words you
still need to be checking manually the forms data to verify it. Consider this
code more of an aid not a solid gate. This is a limitation of Squarespace. They
don't allow access to the back end to alter form validation routines. 

## Demo

You can see a [demo of this effect here][9].
