# Change Form Block Post-Submit Redirect Based on a Radio Form Field Selected Option

*This **code is currently broken** because of the recent (04/23) Squarespace
redesigned form blocks. The specific issue is that SS removed support for the
data-success-redirect attribute which allowed code to programmatically change
the redirect URL on the fly and then SS would handle the actual redirect. Please
contact SS [customer support][1] to encourage them to restore this functionality
that existed in the prevoius version of the form block before the update.*

*I hope to make this code function again in the future.*
