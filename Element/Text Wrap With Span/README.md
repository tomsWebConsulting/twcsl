## Notes

This code is a base for other effects. On its own there is not much in the way
of on page visual change.

The code will wrap your text in a span tag, add a **twc-twws** class name, and
add a **data-twc-twws-text** attribute. With those additions it should provide
some opportunities to style the span tags with your own custom CSS.
