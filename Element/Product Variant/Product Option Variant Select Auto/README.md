## Notes

This code currently does not support Product block Quick View.

If you have Size options defined for two products and they don't have the same
variants, and you set the code to select a variant that doesn't exist in one of
the products, nothing will happen. In other words the code is global in nature.
It doesn't understand all the options and variants for each product. The code is
useful for say a clothing seller where the Size menu is always the same. For
example. Small, Medium, and Large which would be the same across all products.
