## Callbacks

Your callbacks must accept a node as a parameter.

Following is a very generalized example of a callback. The callback(s) must be
defined before the code of this effect. Note the use of var.

```html
<script>

  var pqvocNodeAddedLog = ( node ) => {
  
    console.log ( 'pqvocNodeAddedLog : ', node );
    
    };
    
  </script>
```

## Note

This code is a base for other effects.
