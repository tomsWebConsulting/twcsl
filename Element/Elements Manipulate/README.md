* Options

  When you want have a common element that is available across a number of pages
  they need to be stored in a commonly accessable area like the footer of the
  site.

  * v7.1
  
    * Add a section to the site footer as the last section. Add your source
      blocks there.
      
  * v7.0
  
    * Brine template family
    
      * Put your blocks in the Footer Bottom Blocks and in the **elements
        manipulate.less** file and set **.v7-0-brine** to **true**.
        
    * Bedford template family
    
      * This template only has one footer so you need to create your own CSS to
        hide the common elements.

## Callbacks

You can optionally add [callback][10] functions to further customize the
processing of the source element.

Your callbacks must accept and return a jQuery object.

Following is example code. Place your callbacks before the element manipulate
code. Note the use of var.

```html
<script>

  var twcEmLog = ( $element ) => {
  
    console.log ( 'twcEmLog $element', $element );
    
    return $element;
    
    };
    
  </script>
```
