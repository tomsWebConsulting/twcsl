## Quick Install

* Add code from file **[header account link text replace with first
  name.html][4]** to Website > Pages > Custom Code > Code Injection > FOOTER.
  Refer to [Add code to code injection][5] for details.
  
* Read the code for any instructions within.

##  Notes

The code adds a **twc-haltrwfn** CSS class name to each account link in the page
for use in your custom CSS.

The code does not change Squarespace's default behaviour of having the Account
link text appear, even though you have been automatically signed out of the
member account and need to click the link to sign in again.
