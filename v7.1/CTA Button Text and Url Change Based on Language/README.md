* In the multi-laguage code near the end find the following text.
  ```javascript
    });
  </script>
  ```
  
* Just above the lines in the previous step add code from file
  **[cta button text and url change based on language.js](cta%20button%20text%20and%20url%20change%20based%20on%20language.js#L1)**.

  Be very careful inserting the code. You don't want to change any of the lines
  in the existing code, just add in this new code.
