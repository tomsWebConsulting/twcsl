## Quick Install

* For each event item content at the very end add a line block and the buttons
  you want. **The arrangement of these blocks is critical to the code working.**
  The line block must span the whole twelve column layout. In other words the
  line block must be on a line by itself. Add button blocks below the line
  block, arranged in a row. Only one row of buttons will work. Any more than
  that and the code will not work properly. If you need only one button then
  add the button block and a spacer block in a row. Following are some layout
  examples.

* Add the following to Website > Pages > Website Tools > Code Injection >
  HEADER.
  
  ```html
  <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.7.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
  ```
  
* Add code from file
  **[event content end buttons move to meta.html](event%20content%20end%20buttons%20move%20to%20meta.html#L1)**
  to Event List Settings > Advanced > Page Header Code Injection for the Event
  page.
