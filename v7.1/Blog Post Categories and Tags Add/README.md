## Install

* Install [twcsl][1]. After you install twcsl be sure to continue on with the
  rest of the steps.
  
* Add code from file **[blog post categories and tags add.html][2]** to Blog
  Settings > Advanced > Page Header Code Injection for the blog page. Please see
  [per-page code injection][3].
  
* Read the code for any instructions within.

## How to Use

After the code is installed it will add your blog post categories and tags as
classes to the selector you choose (default is body). For example if you had a
category **Cats and Dogs** it would become a class of
**category-cats-and-dogs**. A tag of **Dogs and Cats** would becomes
**tag-dogs-and-cats**. The basic rule is add a prefix, lowercase, and replace
spaces with dashes.
