## Install

* Install
  [twcsl](https://github.com/tomsWebConsulting/twcsl#install-options).
  
* Install code from
  **[store category theme change.html](store%20category%20theme%20change.html#L1)**.
  Read the code for any instructions within.
  
* For each theme that you want to apply to a category page you need to add a
  section to the store with a code block and particular text. For example lets
  say you want to have a category called red that has a red background. First
  you set up a theme with your background color. There is Squarespace
  documentation that covers that topic, so we won't go into it here.
  
  Edit the Store page. Create a new section. I suggest adding it below the store
  section. Set the height to small. Select a theme. Add a code block. In the
  code block put the text **sctc : red**. I suggest removing the default text
  block. Repeat the previous steps to have different categories have different
  themes. Save the page. For each sctc text you can have multiple categories.
  For example **sctc : red, green, blue**.
