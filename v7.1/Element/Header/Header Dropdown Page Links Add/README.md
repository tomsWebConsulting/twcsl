## Install

* Optional. By default the main code will make the dropdown title a link to the
  first page in the dropdown. To override this default behaviour and use your
  own URLs add code from file **[header dropdown page links add
  options.html][4]** to Website > Pages > Custom Code > Code Injection >
  FOOTER. Read the code for any instructions within.

* Add code from file **[header dropdown page links add.html][5]** to Website >
  Pages > Custom Code > Code Injection > FOOTER.
  
* Refer to [Add code to code injection][6] for details.

## Note

If you install the optional code the default behaviour of the main code is
disabled. If you want that behaviour you need to set it up manually.
