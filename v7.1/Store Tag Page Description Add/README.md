  rest of the steps.

  Settings > Advanced > Page Header Code Injection for the store page. Read the
  code for any instructions within.
  
* In the Store page add a page section as the last section of the store page.
  Add a code block with the following example code.
  
  ```html
  <x-twc-stpda>
  
      [enter tag here replacing square brackets]
      [enter description here replacing square brackets]
      [enter tag here replacing square brackets]

  Add tag and description pairs on lines by themselves. Each tag must match
  exactly what you entered for each tag in the SS interface. Each description
  must be on a single line. Keep in mind that word wrap
