## Install

* Add the following to Website > Pages > Website Tools > Code Injection >
  HEADER.
  
  ```html
  <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.7.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
  ```
  
* Options

  * Page Specific
  
    * This option will be the one most will want to use if you have only a
      single store page you want to have this effect.
      
    * Add code from file **[page sections slide toggle.html][5]** to Page
      Settings > Advanced > Page Header Code Injection for the page. Please see
      [Per-page code injection][6]. Read the code for any instructions within.
      
  * Site-wide
  
    * This option is the one you want to use if you have multiple store pages
      where you want to have this effect.
      
    * Add code from file **[page sections slide toggle.html][5]** to Website >
      Pages > Website Tools > Code Injection > FOOTER. Please see [Add code to
      code injection][7]. Read the code for any instructions within.
      
* Add a section and set it's height to small. This whole section will become a
  clickable zone for the toggle effect.
  
  * Add a text block with text to be used as a label for the section.
  
  * Add a code block and add one of the following.
  
    * Arrow
    
      ```html
      <x-twc-psst>
      
        <svg class="twc-psst-arrow">
                
          <use xlink:href="#twc-psst-arrow">
                  
            </use>
            
          </svg>
          
        </x-twc-psst>
      ```
      
    * Plus
    
      ```html
      <x-twc-psst>
      
        <svg class="twc-psst-plus">
        
          <use xlink:href="#twc-psst-plus-horizontal" />
          
          <use xlink:href="#twc-psst-plus-vertical" />
          
          </svg>
          
        </x-twc-psst>
      ```
      
    Generally you will want to place the code block in horizontal alignment with
    the previous mentioned text block.
    
  * Optional Attributes
  
    Add attributes to the **&lt;x-twc-psst&gt;** opening tag.
    
    * data-section-count
    
      Toggle multiple sections. The default value when this attribute is not
      used is one. This effect does not check that you are using resonable
      values in the context of what you are building. If the wrong values are
      used it can cause unusual results. An example.
      
      ```html
      <x-twc-psst data-section-count="2">
      ```
      
* Add a section after the previous section and add whatever blocks you want to
  the section. This will be the content that gets toggled (hidden/shown).
  
* You can repeat the previous two (or more when using the data-section-count
  attribute) section pattern for as many toggle sections as you want.

## x-twc-psst-close tag

The **&lt;x-twc-psst-close&gt;** tag can be added to a code block at the end
of a section to close the section. This can be useful for long sections so you
don't have to scroll up to click and close the section.

* Arrow

  ```html
  <x-twc-psst-close>
  
    <svg class="twc-psst-arrow">
            
      <use xlink:href="#twc-psst-arrow">
              
        </use>
        
      </svg>
      
    </x-twc-psst-close>
  ```
  
* Plus

  ```html
  <x-twc-psst-close>
  
    <svg class="twc-psst-plus">
    
      <use xlink:href="#twc-psst-plus-horizontal" />
      
      <use xlink:href="#twc-psst-plus-vertical" />
      
      </svg>
      
    </x-twc-psst-close>
  ```
