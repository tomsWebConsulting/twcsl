## How to Use

  * Add or modify a Gallery section.
    
  * Edit the section.
    
  * Select a GALLERY TYPE of Slideshow: Simple, Slideshow: Full, or Slideshow:
    Reel.
    
  * For OPTIONS enable Captions and disable Autoplay (GALLERY TYPE Reel doesn't
    have this option).
    
  * Set the rest of the available settings as desired.
  
  * Edit the Gallery.
  
  * In the DESCRIPTION of the first image, on a new line, add the following.
  
    ```text
    twc-gsraac : { "slideDuration" : 5, "inactivityDelay" : 30, "intersectionObserver" : true }
    ```
    
    * Keys
      
      * slideDuration
        
        The number of seconds a slide is visible or the current slide.
        
      * inactivityDelay
      
        The number of seconds after a user interacts with the gallery the auto
        click will resume. If you set the value to -1 the auto click will stop.
        
      * intersectionObserver
        
        Values are **true** or **false**. True means wait for the Gallery
        section to be mostly visible in the viewport before the first right
        arrow click after the slideDuration. False means start the first right
        click after the slideDuration.
