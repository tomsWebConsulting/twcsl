## Note

Entering HTML in the product title field will put that HTML into the backend.
Your site visitors will see that HTML in their cart, checkout and etc. It looks
ugly and make things confusing.

With this effect you can type in almost anything you want for the separator in
the options. If you use a non-breaking space (option-space on macOS, Alt+0160 on
Windows) it shouldn't cause issues on the backend.
