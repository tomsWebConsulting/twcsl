## How To Use

Lets say you have a site that sells bottles of wine. The bottles of wine have
been rated by entities like Wine Spectator. A bottle of wine you sell
received a rating of 4 out of 5 stars and you want to display that rating to
your site visitors to encourage sales.

Edit the product and add a tag of **twc-sptr Wine Spectator s 4/5**. The
twc-sptr indicates to the code that this is a rating. The entity text is the
rating entity. The **s** tells the code you want to use the symbols set in the
code. The numbers at the end are the rating and the scale.

## Tag Syntax

  * twc-sptr
  
  * rating entity name
  
  * rating type : points, symbols, or words
  
    * use **p**, **s**, or **w**
    
  * rating : the rating/scale numbers or words
  
    * for r/s, note the forward slash separating the rating and scale

```text
twc-sptr [ rating entity name here replacing square brackets ] [ rating type here replacing square brackets ] [ rating here replacing square brackets ]
```

#### Examples

```text
twc-sptr Decanter p 9.5/10
```

```text
twc-sptr Wine Spectator s 4/5
```

```text
twc-sptr Wine Press Northwest w Platinum
```

**Extra spaces or not following the format described will cause a rating to not
be added to a product.**

## Classes

Some classes are provided for styling.

* twc-sptr

  * rating
  
    * label
    
    * points, symbols, and words
    
      * point
      
      * scale
      
      * symbol, true ( filled symbols ), and false ( unfilled symbols )

rating type for symbols. For best result use number and letter characters.
