  * Add a code block as the first block of the section. Make sure it spans the
    entire width of the section. Set the content to the following.
    
    ```html

## Notes

If you want the boilerplate content to be added to the beginning of Additional
Info set the code block content to the following.

```html
<x-twc-spdaiafb data-position="top"/>
```
      
You can find data section ids by using Heather Tovey's [Squarespace ID
Finder][10]. When using SIF you only need the number from between the quotes.
For example if SIF put **section[data-section-id="123456789012345678901234"]**
on your clipboard you would only need to enter **123456789012345678901234** in
Website > Pages > Website Tools > Custom CSS for the **store page detail additional info
add footer boilerplate.css** you added there.

This effect is not active in SS Preview to test it use [private browsing][11].
