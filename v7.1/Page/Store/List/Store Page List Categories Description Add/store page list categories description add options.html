            all the text from the field. if you want to add a description to the
            main store page use All for the category list
            
            for a top level category you would enter something like...
            
              Top Category
              
            For a nested category you enter something like...
            
              Top Category > Sub Category
              
            following is an example entry. copy the example entry below and
            paste after the example entry, removing the double forward slash
            space lines from the beginning of each line. repeat for as many
            categories as you want to add a description. this has been done once
            initially
            
            if your description contains double quote characters they will need
            to be escaped. " becomes \"
