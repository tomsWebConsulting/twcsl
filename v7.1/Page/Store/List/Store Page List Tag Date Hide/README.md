## How To Use

Edit a product and add a tag of **twc-spltdh 2024-03-23 2024-03-25**. The
twc-spltdh indicates to the code that this is a product to be hidden based on
the dates entered. The first date is the date to begin hiding the product, the
second (optional) when the hiding ends.

## Tag Syntax

  * twc-spltdh
  
  * start date ( YYYY-MM-DD )
  
  * stop date ( optional, YYYY-MM-DD )

```text
twc-spltdh [ enter start date here replacing square brackets ] [ enter optional stop date here replacing square brackets ]
```

#### Examples

Hide a product beginning on date.

```text
twc-spltdh 2024-03-24
```

Hide a product for a date range.

```text
twc-spltdh 2024-03-23 2024-03-25
```

Hide a product annually for a date range.

```text
twc-spltdh 1970-03-23 1970-03-25
```

**Using the year 1970 tells the code to replace the year with the current 
one.**

**Extra spaces or not following the format described will cause a product not
to be hidden.**
