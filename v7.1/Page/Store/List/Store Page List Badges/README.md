## Custom Badges

In addition to the Squarespace built-in badges this code lets you add your own
custom badges to products. For example lets say you want to add a **pre-order
badge** to a product. Edit the product. Add a tag with the text **twc splb
pre-order**. You will now see a pre-order badge on the store page list.

## Demo

You can see a [demo of this effect here][7].
