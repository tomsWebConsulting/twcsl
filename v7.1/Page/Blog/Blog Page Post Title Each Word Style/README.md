## How To Use

  * Add a tag to a post starting with **twc-bpptews** space, then text that can
    be used in a CSS class name.
    
  * Example
  
    Lets say you have a blog post title of **Blog Post 001** and want words 2
    and 3 to be italic.
  
    * Add the tag **twc-bpptews words 2-3 italic** to the post.
    
    * Add the following to Website > Pages > Website Tools > Custom CSS.
    
      ```css
      /* blog post title words 2-3 italicize */
      
      .tag-twc-bpptews-words-2-3-italic .blog-title span:nth-child( n+2 ):nth-child( -n+3 ),
      .tag-twc-bpptews-words-2-3-italic .blog-item-wrapper .blog-item-title h1.entry-title span:nth-child( n+2 ):nth-child( -n+3 )
      
        {
        
          font-style : italic;
          
          }
          
      ```
      
    Notes
    
    The Squarespace UI can diplay lots of characters for tags. Those characters
    can't be represented with CSS restrictions for class names. In addition SS
    also strips some characters like _ (underscore), even though CSS class names
    support that character. If you want to produce an underscore character
    you can enter **--UNDERSCORE--** in your tags.
