## Install

  rest of the steps.
  
* Add code from file **[events page event thumbnail add.html][6]** to Events

  [Per-page code injection][7] for details.
  
* Read the code for any instructions within.

## What is a bookmarklet?

Wikipedia has a nice entry on [bookmarklet][9].

By default the code adds the thumbnail to the meta information area of an event.
If you want the thumbnail to be added at the top of the content of the event
follow these steps.

* Create an event to use as a template. Add an inline image block at the top of
  the event.
  
* Set the image block link to **#twc-epefihg**.

* Save the event and exit.
  
You can use spacers to help control the placement, size, and spacing of the
image. Keep the formatting really simple or things may break. This post is only
a template.

* Add code from file **[events page event first image html
  get.bookmarklet][8]** as the URL for a bookmark in your browser named
  **Events Page Event First Image Html Get**.

* In the event template you created select the **Events Page Event First Image
  Html Get** bookmark.
  
A window/tab should pop-up with HTML code in it. If the pop-up doesn't appear be
sure that you don't have a pop-up or ad blocker software that is preventing the
pop-up from opening.

* Copy all the HTML in the pop-up to your clipboard.

* Edit the **Events Page Event Thumbnail Add** code you installed previously and
  paste the HTML where indicated in the code.
