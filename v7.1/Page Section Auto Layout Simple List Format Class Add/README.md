## Install

* Options

  * Page Specific
  
    * Use this option if you have only a single page you want to have this
      effect.

    * Add code from file **[page section auto layout simple list format class
      add.html][1]** to Page Settings > Advanced > Page Header Code Injection
      for the page. Refer to [Per-page code injection][2] for details.
      
  * Site-wide
  
    * Use this option if you have multiple pages where you want to have this
      effect.
      
    * Add code from file **[page section auto layout simple list format class
      add.html][1]** to  Website > Pages > Website Tools > Code Injection >
      FOOTER. Refer to [Add code to code injection][7] for details.
      
* Read the code for any instructions within.

* Add an [Auto layout][3] section and set the **Design** to **Simple List**. You
  can change any of the other settings as desired.
  
* Add your desired content. Add a last item and set the description to
  **twc-psalslfca**. I also prefer to clear the other fields of content but it
  is not required.

  The text **twc-psalslfca** tells the code that you want the effect applied to
  this auto layout section. The text also adds the default classes from a normal
  page section to the auto layout.
  
* You can add settings below the **twc-psalslfca**. Here is an example showing
  the default settings applied as mentioned above.
  
  ![advanced description](read%20me%20assets/advanced%20description.png)
  
  Following are the four settings you can use and their values:
  
  * **section height** and **content width**
  
    * small, medium, or large
    
  * **content alignment vertical**
  
    * top, center, or bottom
    
  * **content alignment horizontal**
  
    * left, center, or right
    
  You do not have to enter all the settings, only the ones that you want to
  override the default values.
