## Quick Install

* Install code from **[Cart Prices Sqs-Money-Native Add][2]**.
  
* Add code from file **[cart unit prices.html][3]** to Website > Pages >
  Website Tools > Code Injection > FOOTER after the **cart prices change** code.

## Notes

Adding unit prices to the cart page does not effect the store/product pages,
checkout, or other SS pages/backend storage. This is purely a cosmetic change.
No code can change the checkout page. It is an SS security feature.

The effect is not active on mobile.
