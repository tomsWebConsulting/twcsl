## Quick Install

Add code from file **[form block edit form field dropdown options
pre-sort.bookmarklet][2]** as the URL for a bookmark in your browser named **TWC
Form Block Edit Form Field Dropdown Options Pre-sort**.

## How to Use

* Edit a Dropdown field of a Form block.

* Use the bookmarklet.

* The OPTIONS will be sorted alphabetically and entered into the Option 1 field
  as a comma separated list. Commas in option fields will be encoded to **\\,**
  (backslash comma). The remaining option fields will be filled with random four
  character strings. This reduces the likelihood that Squarespace UI will
  complain about duplicate values later.
  
* Use the [Form Block Edit Form Field Dropdown Options Add][3] bookmarklet to
  complete sorting the options.
  
## Note

I suggest you duplicate the Dropdown field where you want to sort the OPTIONS as
a backup in case something goes wrong.

## What is a bookmarklet?

Wikipedia has a nice entry on [bookmarklet][4].
