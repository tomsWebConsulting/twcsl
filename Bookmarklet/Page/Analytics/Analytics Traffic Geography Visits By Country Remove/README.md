## Quick Install

Add code from file **[analytics traffic geography visits by country
remove.bookmarklet][2]** as the URL for a bookmark in your browser named **TWC
Analytics Traffic Geography Visits By Country Remove**.

## How to Use

* Go to Analytics > Traffic > Geography. Be sure you see the Visits by Country
  data.

* Use the bookmarklet.

* Enter a comma separated list countries you want to remove from the data. You
  of course can enter just one country.

## Notes

This bookmarklet only addresses the Visits By Country data. It does not address
any other kind of data.

The bookmarklet will remember the last list of countries you entered. You can of
course create lists and store the them somewhere if you need to work with a set
of lists.

Countries will be colored red to remind you they have been removed.

When the page is reloaded you need to run the bookmarklet again.

If you drill down in the Visits By Country data and surface back up to Visits By
Country, the map and the table will be out of sync. In other words the page is
in a spurious state. To reset the data reload the page and use the bookmarklet
again.
