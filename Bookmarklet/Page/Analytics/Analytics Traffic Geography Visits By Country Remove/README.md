## Quick Install

Add code from file **[analytics traffic geography visits by country
remove.bookmarklet][2]** as the URL for a bookmark in your browser named **TWC
Analytics Traffic Geography Visits By Country Remove**.

## How to Use

* Go to Analytics > Traffic > Geography. Be sure you see the Visits by Country
  data.

* Use the bookmarklet.

* Enter a comma separated list countries you want to remove from the data. You
  of course can enter just one country.

## Notes

This bookmarklet only addresses the Visits By Country data. It does not address
any other kind of data.

The bookmarklet will remember the last list of countries you entered. You can of
course create lists and store the them somewhere if you need to work with a set
of lists.

Countries will be colored red to remind you they have been removed.

When the page is reloaded you need to run the bookmarklet again.

The map legend is not altered in any way by this bookmarklet. By extension
nothing related to the legend is altered. In other words removing a countries
data from the page does not readjust the legend or color of the countries, with
the exception of making the remove countries red on the map.

## What is a bookmarklet?

Wikipedia has a nice entry on [bookmarklet][3].
