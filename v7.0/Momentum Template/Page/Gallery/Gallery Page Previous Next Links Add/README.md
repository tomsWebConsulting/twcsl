# Gallery Page Previous Next Links Add

### [License][1]

### Synopsis

Add previous/next links between gallery pages.

### Version

  * 0.1.0

#### SS Version

  * 7.0 ([Momentum template][2])

---

## Quick Install

* Add code from file **[gallery page previous next links add.html][3]** to
  Website > Pages > Custom Code > Code Injection > FOOTER. Refer to [Add code
  to code injection][4] for details.
  
* Add or edit a Gallery page.

* Set the first line of the first image description to something like the
  following.
  
  twc-gppnla : [Previous Gallery](/previous-gallery-url), [Next Gallery](/next-gallery-url)
  
  Use the description link editor to create your links to the previous and next
  gallery URLs.
  
  When you don't have a previous or next gallery page you still need to create a
  link but you set the URL to **#** ( number sign or hash ). Also it doesn't
  matter what the link text is so you can use **#** to remind you that there is
  no previous or next link.
